There was one series per year, with the first four series presented by Richard O'Brien and the final two by Ed Tudor-Pole. Each show was one hour long, including adverts.\n\nThe show was originally intended to be a British remake of the French programme Fort Boyard, devised by Jacques Antoine. However, the unavailability of the French show's set led British producer Malcolm Heyworth to reinvent the show, using themed zones as a means to keep the show visually fresh.\n\nThe series is set in \"The Crystal Maze\", which features four different \"zones\" set in various periods of time and space. A team of six contestants take part in a series of challenges in order to win \"time crystals\". Each crystal gives the team five seconds of time inside \"The Crystal Dome\", the centrepiece of the maze where the contestants take part in their final challenge.\n\nThe maze cost \u00a3250,000 to build and was the size of two football pitches. At its height the show was the most watched on Channel 4, regularly attracting between 4 and 6 million viewers. In 2006 and again in 2010, the show was voted \"greatest UK game show of all time\" by readers of UKGameshows.com.

The series premiered on NBC on September 14, 1985, and aired there for four seasons. The series moved to ABC for one season from 1989 to 1990, and concluded on September 6, 1991 as part of the Disney Afternoon television syndication package. Of the series' 65 shows, 30 were double-features, consisting of two 11-minute cartoons, thereby bringing the series total to 94 distinct episodes overall. The show is well-remembered for its theme music, written by Michael and Patty Silversher and creation of \"gummiberry juice\" which was a topic of magic potion, gaining abilities to defend them against the foes.\n\nThe series was later rebroadcast on the syndicated Disney Afternoon block, and rerun on the Disney Afternoon through the summer of 1991. In later years, it was shown on the Disney Channel and Toon Disney, with its most recent televised airing occurring on Toon Disney on December 28, 2001.

Perpetually skint, bored and sexually frustrated, they spend their days scheming, bickering, and being nasty and sadistic to each other. The show ran for three series, originally airing on BBC Two from 1991 - 1995, and was followed by five stage show tours across the United Kingdom between 1993 and 2003, and a feature film Guest House Paradiso. The show is noted for its chaotic, nihilistic humour and violent comedy slapstick.\n\nIn 2008, Bottom came in at number 45 in a poll to determine \"Britain's Best Sitcom\" by the BBC. The show continues to be shown in the UK on Gold and Dave, and has been dubbed in other languages. In Spain the show is known as La pareja basura which aired on Canal+. The theme music was provided by The Bum Notes, a band that once featured Edmondson, and is a cover of \"Last Night\" by The Mar-Keys.\n\nPlans were made in 2012 for a BBC spin-off series, Hooligan's Island, featuring the Richie and Eddie characters from Bottom. However, that project was cancelled that October prior to production as Edmondson explained that he wished to pursue other interests.","cast":"Adrian Edmondson, Rik Mayall","director":"Adrian Edmondson, Rik Mayall","genre":"Comedy","releaseDate":"1991-09-17","last_modified":"1533391284","rating":"8","rating_5based":4,"backdrop_path":["http:\/\/thesenutz.xyz:2052\/images\/4292_tv_backdrop_0.jpg","http:\/\/thesenutz.xyz:2052\/images\/4292_tv_backdrop_1.jpg","http:\/\/thesenutz.xyz:2052\/images\/4292_tv_backdrop_2.jpg","http:\/\/thesenutz.xyz:2052\/images\/4292_tv_backdrop_3.jpg","http:\/\/thesenutz.xyz:2052\/images\/4292_tv_backdrop_4.jpg"],"youtube_trailer":"","episode_run_time":"30","category_id":"113"},{"num":101,"name":"Drake & Josh","stream_type":null,"series_id":111,"cover":"http:\/\/thesenutz.xyz:2052\/images\/6Dr4dcrheGN83MXOokxDubj8oj0_small.jpg","plot":"Drake & Josh is an American television sitcom created by Dan Schneider for Nickelodeon.
